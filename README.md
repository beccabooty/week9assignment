Reflections:

ðŸŽ¯ What requirements did you achieve?
ðŸŽ¯ Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?
ðŸŽ¯ If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?

I gave all of the requirements a go this week, but I left them unfinished as I ran out of time to complete everything. I felt much better this week as I had a plan and knew what methods/resources to use to execute it. My only issue this week was time as I am a slow coder and only had Friday morning and a bit of Sunday for this project. I do think I was also hopping around as I coded which was probably not the best practice for the submitted product but I wanted to have a go at everything and was enjoying myself! I focused on the requirements for this week as the database functions were something that I had done before and could complete more confidently at a later date.

REQUIREMENTS:
ðŸŽ¯ Set up user sign-up and user login using Clerk.
ðŸŽ¯ Create and display an error/not found page if the user visits a page that doesnâ€™t exist.
ðŸŽ¯ Use 1 or more Radix UI Primitive component, or something similar (e.g. use of a different component library to enhance UX, not just Tailwind).
ðŸŽ¯ Enable users to create a user profile, and input profile information (such as a user biography) using a form. Users and user information should be stored in their own table in the database and handled with an appropriate route (e.g. /user/[userId]).
ðŸŽ¯ Enable users to create posts associated with their Clerk userId. Posts should be displayed on the userâ€™s profile page.
