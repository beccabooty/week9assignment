Reflections:

🎯 What requirements did you achieve?
🎯 Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?
🎯 If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?

Optional
🏹 Feel free to add any other reflections you would like to share about your submission, for example:

Requesting feedback about a specific part of your submission.
What useful external sources helped you complete the assignment (e.g Youtube tutorials)?
What errors or bugs did you encounter while completing your assignment? How did you solve them?
What went really well and what could have gone better?

REQUIREMENTS:
🎯 Set up user sign-up and user login using Clerk.
🎯 Create and display an error/not found page if the user visits a page that doesn’t exist.
🎯 Use 1 or more Radix UI Primitive component, or something similar (e.g. use of a different component library to enhance UX, not just Tailwind).
🎯 Enable users to create a user profile, and input profile information (such as a user biography) using a form. Users and user information should be stored in their own table in the database and handled with an appropriate route (e.g. /user/[userId]).
🎯 Enable users to create posts associated with their Clerk userId. Posts should be displayed on the user’s profile page.
